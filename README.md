# Web-applications for elderly physical exercises 

### The Machine Learning project on Management of Information Technology Class.	  

→ Develop an web application for the elderly, equipped with an AI system that assists them in performing physical exercises accurately and safely.  
→ In this project, we utilize a Random Forest Classifier Model for real-time classification integrated with MediaPipe, which generates landmark coordinate data by detecting user movements by using this we can predicting the precise positioning of elderly exercises.   
→ This work aims to assist the elderly in performing physical exercises accurately and safely by themselves.  

#### Objective of this project

1. To develop management planning and teamwork skills.
2. To create a web application for helping exercise exercises for the elderly with an intelligent assistant by machine learning model.
